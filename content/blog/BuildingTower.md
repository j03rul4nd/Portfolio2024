## Game Development:

"Building Tower" challenges players to stack blocks as high as possible without them collapsing. Using Three.js for 3D graphics rendering and Cannon.js to simulate the physics of the game world, a realistic and immersive gameplay experience is achieved. The game mechanics involve precise block placement, with realistic consequences if placed incorrectly.

## Key Features:

- **Autopilot Mode:** Players can choose to let a precise algorithm place the blocks automatically, challenging them to beat their own score.
- **Intuitive Interface:** The design and clear instructions make it easy for users to understand and enjoy the game from the outset.
- **Realistic Physics:** Blocks behave realistically, offering an authentic and challenging gameplay experience.

## User Experience:

The combination of impressive graphics, realistic physics, and an intuitive interface creates an immersive and attractive user experience. Soft colors and clear instructions make the game accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.

## Conclusion:

"Building Tower" showcases mastery in game development and a deep understanding of technologies such as JavaScript, Three.js, and computational physics. If you're looking for a software developer with skills in game development and experience with advanced web technologies, this project demonstrates abundant capability and creativity.
