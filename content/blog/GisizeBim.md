## Innovation in 3D: My Experience Developing GISize BIM 3D for Becolve Digital

I am Joel Ben√≠tez Donari, a software developer in the R&D department of Becolve Digital. My career at the company has been marked by participation in innovative projects, especially my contribution to the development and migration of GISize BIM 3D, an essential application for the management and visualization of 3D models in industrial and construction environments.

### What is GISize BIM 3D?

GISize BIM 3D is an advanced tool that allows users to visualize, interact with, and manage complex 3D models. This application is vital for companies that need detailed and accurate infrastructure visualization, facilitating decision-making and project management on a large scale. With GISize BIM 3D, users can navigate through 3D models of buildings, industrial plants, and other infrastructures, enabling thorough inspection and detailed analysis of each component.

### Success Stories and Use Cases of GISize BIM 3D

GISize BIM 3D has been adopted by various industries, showcasing its versatility and efficiency in multiple use cases:

- **Construction**: Construction companies have used GISize BIM 3D for planning and managing building projects, allowing engineers and architects to visualize project progress in real-time and detect potential issues before they occur.
- **Industrial Plants**: In the industrial sector, GISize BIM 3D has facilitated the management of large plants, allowing better planning and maintenance of complex facilities.
- **Urban Infrastructure**: Municipal governments have employed GISize BIM 3D for urban planning, improving space management and facilitating decision-making based on accurate data.

### The Challenge of Migration to the Web

The most challenging project I've worked on is the migration of GISize BIM 3D from a desktop platform to a web application, maintaining its compatibility with System Platform OMI. This process involved transferring a robust 3D engine to the web without losing any functionality while improving performance and user experience.

#### Tools and Technologies Used

To achieve this, we used an advanced set of web tools and technologies:

- **WebGL and WebAssembly**: For efficient 3D graphics rendering on the web.
- **TypeScript and Vite**: For developing a modular and scalable web application.
- **Three.js**: For creating and managing 3D scenes.
- **Blazor**: For developing the user interface with reusable and reactive components.

### Overcoming Technical Challenges

The biggest obstacle was ensuring that the browser could handle the load of complex 3D models without becoming overloaded. We implemented advanced 3D rendering techniques, memory optimization, and resource management to ensure smooth navigation and an uninterrupted user experience.

### My Contribution to the Project

In this project, my role was primarily in frontend development and user interface. I worked closely with the graphic design team to create an intuitive and efficient UI. Additionally, I implemented advanced features for customization and handling of 3D models, using modern and advanced architectural patterns such as the Observer pattern to ensure efficient communication between components.

### Innovation and Continuous Improvement

During development, we adopted design systems with CSS variables for better UI control and maintainability. Using cutting-edge tools and advanced architectural patterns allowed GISize BIM 3D not only to retain its essential functionalities but also to offer superior performance and an improved user experience.

### Current Status and Future of the Project

Although GISize BIM 3D is still in development, we are very close to launching a web version that promises to revolutionize how users interact with complex 3D models. This new version will offer exceptional performance, ensuring that users can manage and visualize models more efficiently and easily. The release of this version will be a significant milestone, allowing users to access the tool from any location and device with an internet connection.
