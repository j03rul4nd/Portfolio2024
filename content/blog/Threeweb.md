## WebSocket Connection for 3D Visualization and Real-Time Global Chat

In my continuous pursuit of exploring new technologies and creating interactive experiences, I have undertaken an exciting project that highlights the implementation of a WebSocket connection. This technology enables a shared 3D visualization experience and real-time global chat. This project not only showcases my skills in web development but also underscores my ability to create interactive and collaborative environments.

## WebSocket Connection for 3D Visualization

At the core of this project is the implementation of a WebSocket connection, facilitating real-time communication between the server and the client. By utilizing the Three.js library, I successfully visualized 3D figures and models on a three-dimensional plane. This not only adds an additional dimension to the user experience but also allows interaction with these models in real-time.

Users can navigate through the 3D plane, explore different perspectives, and experiment with the visualization of three-dimensional models. The true innovation lies in the ability of users to share this environment in real-time. Thanks to the WebSocket connection among users, they can observe how others interact and move within the same 3D plane, creating a unique collaborative experience.

## Real-Time Global Chat

In addition to the shared 3D visualization, I implemented a global chat that enables users to interact with each other. The WebSocket connection plays a crucial role here, facilitating instant communication among all participants. Users can exchange messages, share ideas, and discuss the visualized 3D models.

This global chat adds a social layer to the project, transforming it into a space not only for 3D visual exploration but also for communication and collaboration among users. The synergy between shared visualization and real-time global chat creates a unique experience that goes beyond mere observation of 3D models.

## Conclusions

This project highlights not only my technical skills in web development, especially in the implementation of WebSocket and the use of Three.js but also my ability to create interactive and collaborative experiences. The combination of shared 3D visualization and real-time global chat opens up new possibilities in terms of interactivity and collaboration in virtual environments, positioning me as a versatile professional at the forefront of web technology.
